This project is fairly simple.
It proxies camera feeds from multiple ESP32 based camera's, and allows creating multiple endpoints to those cameras.
Additionally adds the ability to auto reconnect to temporarily disconnected camera's without interreuption to software that listens to the proxied camera feed.
